The scale-free property strongly correlates with the network's
robustness to failure. It turns out that the major hubs are closely
followed by smaller ones. These smaller hubs, in turn, are followed by
other nodes with an even smaller degree and so on. This hierarchy
allows for a fault tolerant behavior. If failures occur at random and
the vast majority of nodes are those with small degree, the likelihood
that a hub would be affected is almost negligible. Even if a
hub-failure occurs, the network will generally not lose its
connectedness, due to the remaining hubs. On the other hand, if we
choose a few major hubs and take them out of the network, the network
is turned into a set of rather isolated graphs. Thus, hubs are both a
strength and a weakness of scale-free networks. These properties have
been studied analytically using percolation theory by Cohen et
al.[9][10] and by Callaway et al.[11]
